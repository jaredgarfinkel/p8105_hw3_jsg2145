```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
instacart
```

The "instacart" dataset is `r nrow(instacart)` rows by `r ncol(instacart)` columns. 

There are a few variables that appear to be key to telling us what the dataset is. 

The variable "product_name" is an item that was placed in a cart. Order have an "order_id" number.

Each item in a cart has an "add_to_cart_order", for instance, in the head of the data, "order_id" 1

had 8 items added, 1 through 8 and "add_to_cart_order" gives the order in which the 

items were added.  There are columns that tell the time of day of the order, the days 

since the prior order, and whether a specific item was reordered or not. There are 

also details about where the item is found (aisle, department)

```{r}
instacart %>% 
  distinct(aisle)
```
