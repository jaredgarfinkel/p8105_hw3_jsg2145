The “instacart” dataset is 1384617 rows by 15 columns.

There are a few variables that appear to be key to telling us what the
dataset is.

The variable “product\_name” is an item that was placed in a cart. Order
have an “order\_id” number.

Each item in a cart has an “add\_to\_cart\_order”, for instance, in the
head of the data, “order\_id” 1

had 8 items added, 1 through 8 and “add\_to\_cart\_order” gives the
order in which the

items were added. There are columns that tell the time of day of the
order, the days

since the prior order, and whether a specific item was reordered or not.
There are

also details about where the item is found (aisle, department)

``` r
instacart %>% 
  distinct(aisle)
```
