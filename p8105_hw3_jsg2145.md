``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

The “instacart” dataset is 1384617 rows by 15 columns.

There are a few variables that appear to be key to telling us what the
dataset is.

The variable “product\_name” is an item that was placed in a cart. Order
have an “order\_id” number.

Each item in a cart has an “add\_to\_cart\_order”, for instance, in the
head of the data, “order\_id” 1

had 8 items added, 1 through 8 and “add\_to\_cart\_order” gives the
order in which the

items were added. There are columns that tell the time of day of the
order, the days

since the prior order, and whether a specific item was reordered or not.
There are

also details about where the item is found (aisle, department)

``` r
aisle_dat <- instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))
```

## Problem 1

There are 134 aisles, and fresh vegetables was the aisle the most items
were ordered from.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  filter(
    n > 10000
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(xlab = "Count",
       ylab = "Aisle")
```

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

There are 50400 rows and 6 columns in this dataset. There is a minute

variable for each minute of a day, a weekday variable for whether the
day of the week is a weekend or

a weekday, a week variable for each of the five weeks of observations,
and a variable, “day\_id” for

each day in the study. The final variable measures the activity of the
subject at each interval.
